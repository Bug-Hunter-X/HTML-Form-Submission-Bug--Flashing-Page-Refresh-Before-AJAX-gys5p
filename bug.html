<p>This is a common issue when working with HTML forms and JavaScript. The problem is caused by the way browsers handle form submissions. By default, when a form is submitted, the browser will automatically refresh the page. This behavior is often undesired if you intend to submit data asynchronously via AJAX to avoid page refresh and provide a better user experience. </p><p>Here's an example of how this issue might manifest itself in your code:</p><pre><code>&lt;form id="myForm" action="/submit" method="post">  &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;  &lt;button type="submit">Submit&lt;/button>&lt;/form>  &lt;script&gt;  document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {    event.preventDefault();    // Your AJAX submission logic here...  });&lt;/script></code></pre><p>In this scenario, although we prevent the default form submission behavior using <code>event.preventDefault()</code>, the browser will still briefly attempt a regular submission before the AJAX call is processed. This creates the visible flash and can lead to unexpected behavior if not correctly handled.</p>
